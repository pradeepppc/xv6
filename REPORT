Here I am presenting outputs of the terminal while running the xv-6 .


==> First I have created two process in which each process creates a child process .

==> Now cptest gives the list of processes in the os currently .

==> Just after running the test program the output of cptest is as follows

	name _______  process_id _______ status  
	init		1		SLEEPING
	sh		2		SLEEPING	
	test		8		RUNNABLE
	test		9		RUNNINGS	
	test		5		SLEEPING	
	test		7		SLEEPING	
	cptest		11		RUNNINGS	

==> In the above case there are 4 test programs 2 parent 2 child  I have added wait for parent so they were in slleping state .

==> Among the both the child processes only one is running ie 9.

==> Now change the priority of the process 8 to 24 .

==> after changing the  cptest output is 
	name _______  process_id _______ status _______ priority 
	init		1		SLEEPING	3
	sh		2		SLEEPING	3
	test		8		RUNNINGS	25
	test		9		RUNNABLE	60
	test		5		SLEEPING	3
	test		7		SLEEPING	3
	cptest		13		RUNNINGS	3
==> after changing the priority now 8 running because it has more priority .


==> If we have general round robin scheduler the output is 

		name _______  process_id _______ status                 
        	init            1               SLEEPING
        	sh              2               SLEEPING
        	test            8               RUNNABLE
        	test            9               RUNNINGS
        	test            5               SLEEPING
        	test            7               SLEEPING
        	cptest          11              RUNNINGS

==> The roundrobin scheduler only takes next one after completion of the process 9.
